# 🚧 SaaSForAll — STILL COOKING, BESTIE 😭🔥

Hiiii 👋 it’s ya boy **Vishrut Kumar**, founder, builder, sleepless gremlin behind **SaaSForAll** — the place where startups learn they don’t actually need to sell a kidney to pay for SaaS.

## 🧩 If You're Seeing This Page…

Congrats??
You’ve unlocked the **“nothing is ready yet lol”** stage of product development.
If this page is in your face it means:

* The feature is cooking (let him cook) 🍳
* The code is fighting for its life (I love cursor and coderabbit lmaaao) 😭
* I am debugging in 4K (machine is learning)
* And the release is currently in **coding rave**

Pls relax. Pls hydrate. Pls come back later.

## 🛠 Why SaaSForAll?

Because SaaS companies out here charging $49/month for **vibes and two buttons**.
Like babe… be so fr.
There’s a whole open-source ecosystem outside and they want you to pay rent for a webhook.

I said **NO ❤️** and built this instead.

## 🧪 What’s Going On Behind The Scenes?

This part of the project is in its:

* “trust the process” era
* “manifesting productivity” arc
* “IDE has crashed but we move” phase

Release date?
Yes.
